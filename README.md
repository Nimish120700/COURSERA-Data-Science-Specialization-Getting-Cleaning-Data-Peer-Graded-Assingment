# About the README file
- This assignment's purpose is to demonstrate the students' ability to collect, clean and work on the data. 
- A zipped file is provided containing all the required dataset.
- This README file delineates the structure of the R code. All the steps are explained in brief which are also presented as comments in the original R script. 
- Information about the variables is included in a separate Codebook file

# About the R Script
- The R scipt 'run_analysis.R' is divided into 3 parts. Each part consists of certain steps.   

**PART 0 : Downloading necessary libraries and dataset.**   
  STEP1 : Loading required libraries for the purpose of analysis.  
  STEP2 : Downloading and Unzipping the dataset  
  STEP3 : Reading the necessary meta-data into R.   
  STEP4 : Formatting the Train and Test text files.  
    STEP4.1 : Reading Test data   
    STEP4.2 : Reading Train data   
    
**PART 1 : Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set**  
  STEP5 : Merging the train and test datasets   
  STEP6 : Naming the Columns. Here the transverse function is used.   
  STEP7 : Merging all the data into one dataset  

**PART 2 : Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set**   
  STEP8 : Giving appropriate labels  
  STEP9: Creating a secondary tidy data set
